This is a react based web application that allows you to guess a random animal. Once you select the animal, the position of all the animals with randomly change position. The goal of the game is to get all 12 animals guessed without selecting the same animal!

Motivation
The goal was to showcase my skills in react by building a basic react app that has multiple components and props.

UI/UX
The design of the application uses Bootstrap 4 as a framework. It is intentionally designed to be responsive to your device. The colors used give the user a welcoming feeling with less strain on the eyes.

Technologies Used
